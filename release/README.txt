Kowai Shashin ~Tales in Spirit Photography~ (December 2021)

## Intro ##
Experience the infamous haunted kusoge in English for the first time! Join Hiori,
an exorcist who specializes in purification through photos, as she takes on requests
to shed light on strange things happening in the world. As her exorcisms continue and
her powers grow, she finds herself having an insatiable hunger for something not
of this world. Will you see her story all the way to the end?

This patch has been tested with a CD-R and XStation on a modded PS1, soft modded PS2,
and PSP without issue.


## 3 Ways to Experience ##
This patch comes with some bonus hacks to change your experience as you see fit.
Memory card save files are compatible across all 3 versions, so you may alternate
between them as you see fit. Note that save states are *not* compatible across versions;
you have to save and load from the memory card if you want to switch.

# Original #
Experience the game as it was originally released. Exorcism inputs are always
the same set of sequences for the whole game, so you can feel your exorcism
skills grow with Hiori as you memorize the patterns. Patterns will change and
become more challenging on your second and third playthroughs though, so be prepared!

# Visual Novel Edition #
Are you frustrated with the game, or do you just want to experience the story?
Visual Novel Edition greatly simplifies the gameplay. Your health will not go down.
The ghosts will only attack from the bottom, which is the X direction.
All exorcisms only have 1 button prompt. It's X.
This hack is also known as the "Press X to Continue" patch.

# Randomized Inputs Edition #
Are you the opposite from above and want an extra challenge? That or are you tired
of the repetition and want the game to be more varied? Randomized Inputs Edition
does exactly what you'd expect and changes the button prompts every time! Each
exorcism still has the same number of buttons to push and the same timer, so
the second and third times through the game will be a bit more challenging still.


## Installation ##
* The patcher expects the BIN version of the game *
- Drag and drop the BIN file onto "Drag and drop BIN on me.bat".
- A .bin and a .cue file for each version of the game will be generated next to the
  patcher.
- Enjoy!

* If you're not on Windows but can run xdelta3, use the .xdelta3 files in the
"patch_data" folder on your BIN file to apply the patch. All 3 patch files are
designed to run against the original Japanese BIN file.
- kowai-shashin-patch.xdelta3 is the original version patch.
- kowai-shashin-vn-patch.xdelta3 is the visual novel edition patch.
- kowai-shashin-random-patch.delta3 is the randomized inputs patch.


## Tips ##
- You can only save in certain parts of the story. The first save point is after the first
  3 photos.
- To unlock all the album entries, you must complete the game three times, with each
  pass unlocking more entires. The game gets more challenging each time, so beware...
